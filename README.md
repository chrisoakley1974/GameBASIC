# GameBASIC

A modern experimental engine by Chris Oakley that lets you build fast-paced, pixel-perfect arcade games just like the classics of the 80s and 90s! Unleash your creativity, code your own sprites, and bring the golden age of gaming back to life, right in your browser, and export them into a fully working html file.

Think ZX Spectrum BASIC, BBC Micro BASIC, STOS and AMOS all-in-one.
